### What I do
- Architect and deliver cloud‑native products end‑to‑end (TypeScript/Node.js, React, MongoDB/Postgres) with Azure‑first deployments and Dockerized runtimes. [attached_file:1]
- Design secure APIs, optimize data paths, and ship with CI/CD on GitHub Actions to cut release friction and improve reliability. [attached_file:1]
- Mentor engineers, seed testing culture with Jest, and bring playbooks for uptime, observability, and rollback safety. [attached_file:1]

### Selected impact
- CTO, Agricope: shipped an e‑commerce MVP in <6 months; 50% faster page loads; 99.95% uptime; release time cut by ~90% via Docker + Actions. [attached_file:1]
- CarFlow: RBAC admin portal and tuned schemas; sub‑150ms APIs; coverage to ~85% with Jest; critical bugs down ~60%. [attached_file:1]
- Q‑Auto: full vehicle‑service platform (React + Node + MongoDB on AWS) with real‑time tracking and auto‑PDF; inspections 30% faster, CSAT +15%. [attached_file:1]
- QMap: geospatial backend (Node/Express) + Mapbox GL front‑end; vector‑indexed nearest‑neighbor <100ms; API latency -40%. [attached_file:1]
- Roya Venture Studio: real‑time roadside assistance platform (REST core + Flutter apps + web admin); AI intake using LLMs with LangChain + n8n to cut kickoff by ~70%. [attached_file:1]

### Current focus
- Scaling a startup–expert marketplace with integrated hiring and task workflows; first 50+ experts and 20 startups onboarded. [attached_file:1]
- Bespoke ecommerce for a charity: merchandise, tickets, and donations unified with streamlined ops. [attached_file:1]

### Principles
- Typed first: schema + types to prevent drift and enable confident refactors. [attached_file:1]
- Automate the boring: build, test, scan, release, and rollback on rails with GitHub Actions. [attached_file:1]
- Measure what matters: latency, error budgets, cost, and adoption—not just vanity metrics. [attached_file:1]
- Coach and codify: playbooks, templates, and CI checks to scale quality through teams. [attached_file:1]

### Recent projects
- Real‑time roadside assistance: central REST API, web admin, Flutter ops apps; improved visibility and reduced wait times. [attached_file:1]
- Expert marketplace: responsive web app with integrated hiring and tasking; active scaling phase post initial cohort. [attached_file:1]
- Charity ecommerce: unified merch, tickets, and donations with clean back‑office flows. [attached_file:1]
- 3D product configurator: Unity tool that lifted demo engagement by ~25%. [attached_file:1]
